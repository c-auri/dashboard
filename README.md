# Admin Dashboard
This project is part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-intermediate-html-and-css-admin-dashboard).

I decided to do a copy of the provided design and to not get too creative with it. Instead, I took this as an opportunity to get some exercise in responsiveness.

The layout is responsive down to screen sizes 400px wide. As of now the fonts don't change size and some of the header spacing is not ideal, but it's good enough for now.

## What I've learned
- Parcel
  - watching SCSS files
  - working with separated dev and dist environments
  - subtree push to gh-pages branch
- HTML
  - Emmet shortcuts
  - Semantic HTML
- SCSS
  - resets first, then basic fonts and images, only then start with the layout
  - @use and @forward instead of @import
  - utility classes!
  - applying SVG filters on hover

## Possible Improvements
- Add expandable mobile navigation
- Add hover effects for the buttons and the main menu links
- Add toggle effects for notification bell and project buttons
- Make font sizes responsive
- Improve sidebar width for medium screen sizes
- Improve secondary header spacing for medium screen sizes
- Improve accessibility
